  # The earliest date for pulling issues into Jellyfish (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
  # Most companies want at least a year's worth of issues pulled into Jellyfish.
  # You'll generally just need to set this once, at onboarding time, and then

# 3. Git configuration
#############################

# You can configure the agent to pull from a single Git instance or multiple Git
# instances.
#   - If you're pulling from a single Git instance, configure the "git"
#     object as a SINGLE OBJECT as per the example below.
#   - If you're pulling from multiple Git instances, configure the "git"
#     object as a LIST OF OBJECTS as per the example below.  For this
#     configuration, note that the instance_slug and creds_envvar_prefix
#     are additional required fields.

git:
  # Supported providers are `bitbucket_server`, `bitbucket_cloud`,
  # `gitlab` and `github`.
  provider: bitbucket_server

  # URL to Bitbucket Server, Bitbucket Cloud, GitLab, or GitHub.
  # For Bitbucket Cloud, this should be https://api.bitbucket.org
  # For GitHub Cloud, this should be https://api.github.com
  # For GitHub Enterprise, this should be https://github.yourcompany.com/api/v3 (note lack of trailing slash).
  # Otherwise, use the URL to your local git server.
  url: https://bitbucket.yourcompany.com

  # Only pull from specific projects / organizations / groups.
  # Bitbucket Server: use project keys, not names. Comment this out to pull from all projects.
  # Bitbucket Cloud (required): use your organization name, as it appears in your Bitbucket URLs
  # GitHub (required): use your organization name, as it appears in your GitHub URLs (e.g.: MyOrg)
  # GitLab (required): use the top-level GitLab "Group ID" (e.g.: 123)
  include_projects:

  # GitLab: use the top-level GitLab "Group ID" (e.g.: 123)
  #  exclude_projects:

  # Bitbucket cloud only: the include_projects filter above maps to
  # top-level organization for bitbucket cloud. If you've grouped your

  # pull only from repos in particular projects.  Specify projects by
  # key (e.g.: PROJ1)

  #     - PROJ1
  #
  # exclude_bitbucket_cloud_projects:
