'''
Guidance on logging/printing in the agent:

stdout (e.g., print() output) is for the customer/operator; it should include
 - info on run progress: tqdm output, etc.
 - errors/warnings encountered

logger output is for Jellyfish; it should include
 - function entry/exit timings
 - loop iteration timings/liveness indicators
 - errors/warnings encountered

logger output is submitted to Jellyfish, so should only contain non-sensitive data:
e.g., function names, iteration counts

Since we generally want errors/warnings to go to BOTH stdout and the logger, we
should generally use log_and_print() instead of logger.whatever().
