## Details

This will help the agent work with your systems! Using a sample YAML file, we'll ask you to put in some details for your systems, and specify the customization options you'd like.


## Instructions

1. Copy this [example YAML configuration file](https://github.com/Jellyfish-AI/jf_agent/blob/master/example.yml).

2. Using this example file, fill out fields such as your Jira URL and Git URL. Uncomment configuration options as desired.

3. Save the YAML file on the host that will execute the agent.
