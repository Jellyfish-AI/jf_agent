<h2 id="when-setting-up-an-agent-what-are-the-recommended-cpumemorystorage-specs">When setting up an Agent, what are the recommended CPU/memory/storage specs?</h2>

<p>2+GB of RAM, 20+GB of storage, 2+ cores</p>

<p>The standard we usually go off of is &gt;=2GB of RAM. In terms of storage, this varies a bit as it can be hard to predict how much storage you may need, but weâ€™ve never seen &gt;20GB. Aside from those, any amount of CPU should work, but if you need a minimum, set it for 2 CPU cores.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re using kubernetes, run the agent as a kubernetes job, as explained <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-the-agent-auto-update-is-there-a-way-to-initiate-a-manual-update-of-the-agent-or-does-it-require-a-deploy-of-an-updated-docker-image">Does the Agent auto-update, is there a way to initiate a manual update of the agent, or does it require a deploy of an updated docker image?</h2>

<p>Clients can auto-update the Agent before every run. In the cron job/automated run, you can run a docker pull to get the latest version of the Agent.</p>

<p>You can refer to the full agent updating instructions <a href="agent-updated.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-a-communications-channel-that-lets-us-know-when-an-agent-update-is-available-are-release-log-details-such-as-features-additions-security-fixes-etc-included">Is there a communications channel that lets us know when an agent update is available? Are release log details such as features additions, security fixes, etc. included?</h2>

<p>A member of Jellyfishâ€™s Product Success team will reach out with notifications to update the Agent. Logs are captured by the client and can be reviewed at any time.</p>

<h2 id="how-should-we-have-the-agent-run-once-set-up">How should we have the agent run once set up?</h2>

<p>Usually utilizing a k8s cronjob, most clients utilize a once or twice a day cadence for their agent configuration. The agent will exit after itâ€™s done its initial pull and weâ€™d recommend not having it restart immediately after completion. The agent checks the most recent timestamp of commit and only pulls in items after that point. But if we donâ€™t have a most recent timestamp yet (our whole processing pipeline needs to complete), weâ€™ll run through all repos again like it never happened.</p>

<p>See more documentation on how to run the agent <a href="run-agent.html">here</a></p>

<h2 id="can-we-cherry-pick-certain-epics-go-into-jellyfish-via-the-agent">Can we cherry-pick certain Epics go into Jellyfish via the Agent?</h2>

<p>Clients can select which Projects and fields to send to Jellyfish.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the Jira fields that can be specified <a href="jira-fields.html">here</a>.</p>
