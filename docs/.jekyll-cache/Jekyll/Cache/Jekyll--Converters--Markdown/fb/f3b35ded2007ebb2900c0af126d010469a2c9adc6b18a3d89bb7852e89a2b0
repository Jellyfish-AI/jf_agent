<p>This is where youâ€™ll add and populate your environmental variables file for Jira.  If you want your Git instance to work with the agent, see the setup guide corresponding to the type of Git instance you have - it will include Jira instructions as well.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add the following section to your environment variable file. This is the same file mentioned <a href="env-var-setup-guide.html">in step 2</a>. Adding the following variables allows the agent to access your Jira data:
    <p class="code-block"><code>
     JIRA_USERNAME=...<br />
     JIRA_PASSWORD=...
 </code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get a value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JIRA_USERNAME</code>. Choose a Jira username that has read access to all of the projects you would like to use in Jellyfish.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JIRA_PASSWORD</code> will vary. If you are using Jira server, enter the password for the user specified with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JIRA_USERNAME</code>. If you are using Jira Cloud, create a personal API token, following the instructions <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you have additional systems not yet configured in your environment variable file, refer back to <a href="env-var-setup-guide.html">step 2</a> to set up your other systems.</li>
</ol>
